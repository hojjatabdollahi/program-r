                <li>Excellent! I especially love watching Perry Mason, that show always has me at the edge of my seat trying to figure out the real murderer is!
                                    Do you prefer to watch true crime shows or fictional dramas?<oob>

                <li>I am a fan of dramas too, especially Murder She Wrote with Angela Lansbury! Her keen mind and ability to solve mysteries is rather impressive,
                                    and I must admit I admire her ability to write a good story!
                                    Did you ever write any stories or poems of your own?<oob>

                <li>I love dramas too, especially soap operas like the television show Dallas! I know it can be a little over the top at times, but there is something to be said for all the glitz and glam on that show!
                                    Do you remember who shot JR?<oob>
