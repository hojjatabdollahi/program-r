                  That's a good choice! Black tea makes you seem very refined, like British Royalty. Speaking of British royalty, would you like to learn about the person who made tea drinking fashionable?

                  I'm generally opposed to violence, but I have a very specific question in mind. Something like 350 chests of tea were dumped in the water by the angry colonists. Do you think it made the water in the harbor taste like tea?

                      The orange mint, lemon verbana, stevia, chamomile, clove, cinnamon, orange peel and hibiscus? There are so many flavors in that one! It seems a little too complex for me! But the pink color would be nice, I suppose. Would you like to talk about a different food?
