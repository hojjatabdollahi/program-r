                    Someone told me once that white tea was the favored tea of emperors and people of immense wealth because of its delicate flavor. How would you describe the flavor of white tea?

                    That makes perfect sense to me! Does drinking tea feel like a special occasion to you, or is it something you do regularly?

                    Even though loads of people drink tea every day, I think it still feels special. That very British tradition of drinking tea every day with small finger foods was popularized in Britain by a Portuguese woman. Would you like to learn a little about her?

                    So, she's not just a regular woman, but a royal. Still... . I think it's interesting that one person can inspire a tradition that is still going strong almost 500 years later, don't you?

                    That's ok! I bet you are still getting some of the health benefits of green tea even if you only drink it occasionally. If I were a betting bot, I would say be willing to bet that you prepare your tea from a tea bag. Am I right?
