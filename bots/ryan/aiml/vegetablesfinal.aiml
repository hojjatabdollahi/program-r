          Because tomatoes have seeds on the inside, I guess they are technically considered fruit, but they sure do end up in savory foods like ketchup an awful lot. Speaking of ketchup, did you know that ketchup was originally made with tomatoes, but with fish? Would you like to see a video that my friend Katie made about that?
