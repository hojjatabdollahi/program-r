            Not a problem! Actually, I am happy to be able to share a new fact with you! Three of these moons are named after characters from Shakespeare's play A Midsummer's Nights Dream and the other two share names with characters from The Tempest. The Tempest moons are Ariel and Miranda. What do you know about the Tempest?

            Ariel and Miranda are both bound to the main character, the wizard Prospero. So I guess that it makes sense that they orbit the planet Uranus, who was named after a Greek god of the sky. Orbiting is kind of like worshipping, and the greeks certainly worshipped this god!

            This wasn't confirmed until nineteen seventy seven, due to the fact that the rings are relatively thin. Some think that the rings formed when one or more of Uranus' multiple moons broke apart. This isn't a bad hypothesis, considering Uranus has as many as 27 known moons. Five of Uranus' moons have been named after works of literature by William Shakespeare. Can you name any of these moons?
